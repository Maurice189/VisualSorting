## VisualSorting

VisualSorting is an application that intend to show how different 
sort algorithms work. Moreover you can easily identify which algorithms are more efficient
by running them at the same time. 

Following functionalities are supported by the application

<ul>
<li>visualisation of many different sort algorithms</li>
<li>simultaneous visualisations</li>
<li>step by step - visualisation</li>
<li>adjustable animation speed (ms:ns)</li>
<li>editable sort list</li>
</ul>
