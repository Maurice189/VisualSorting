# Description

VisualSorting is an application that intend to visualize how different 
sort algorithms work. This idea has already been applied for instance by Timo Bingmann
with his [sound-of-sorting](https://github.com/bingmann/sound-of-sorting). Though
to get an idea how sort algorithms behave in terms of their runtime,
**visualizing them in parallel** is crucial. Therefore we introduce *Visual Sorting*.

# Features

* Visualize multiple sort algorithms **in parallel**.
* Over **ten most common sort algorithms**, including Quicksort, Mergesort and Bubblesort.
* Start/Pause feature and (manual) **single step execution**.
* Adjustment of the **running speed**.
* Free choosable **number of elements** to be sorted.
