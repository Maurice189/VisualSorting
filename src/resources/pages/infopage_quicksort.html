    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>Quick sort, or partition-exchange sort and is based on the <b>divide and conquer</b> paradigm (likewise merge sort).
        The list is partitioned into two areas by choosing a certain <b>pivot element</b>. The area left to the pivot
        contains the items that are less than the pivot, whereas elements greater than
        the pivot are positioned in the right area to the pivot. This step is done recursively.
        The selection of the pivot is arbitrarily in terms of correctness, though it greatly <b>affects the
        overall efficiency of quick sort</b>. The optimal strategy subdivides the list in two equally sized areas, which means the <b>pivot has
        to be median</b>. However calculating the median algorithmically is computationally not beneficial.
        The following list contains only some possible (not necessarily useful) <b>strategies for computing the pivot</b>
        position.

        <ul>
            <li>Choose pivot from fixed position (for e.g always the first)</li>
            <li>Choose pivot position randomly.</li>
            <li>Choose pivot from median of three.</li>
        </ul>

    Additionally, quick sort's sequential and localized memory references work <b>well with a cache</b>. Quick sort is a comparison sort and, in efficient implementations,
    is <b>not a stable sort</b> and it is often <b>faster in practice than other O(<i>n</i> log <i>n</i>) algorithms</b>.
