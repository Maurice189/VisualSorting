    <h2>Abstract</h2>
	<p>Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted,
		<b>comparing each pair of adjacent items</b> and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.
	The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.
		The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list. Since larger
        elements will win more swaps they will likely to be positioned at the end of the list
        - those elements are called <b>rabbits</b>. On the other side small elements will slowly move
        to the beginning of the list (loosing many swaps) - therefore they are called <b>turtles</b>.
        Although bubble sort is in general much slower than other sort algorithms, like quick sort,
        it may outperform common O(<i>n log n</i>) algorithms, when the <b>list of elements is
            almost sorted</b> - this makes bubble sort an <i>adaptive sorting algorithm</i>.
