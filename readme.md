# Description

Visual Sorting is an application that intend to visualize how different 
sort algorithms work. This idea has already been applied for instance by Timo Bingmann
with his [sound-of-sorting](https://github.com/bingmann/sound-of-sorting). Though
to get an idea how sort algorithms behave in terms of their runtime,
**visualizing them in parallel** is crucial. Therefore we introduce *Visual Sorting*.

The (core) development of Visual Sorting is still in progress, so you may encounter misbehavior
during execution. In that case I would highly appreciate a bug report. Thanks in advance !

# Features

![visual-sorting-teaser.gif](visual-sorting-teaser.gif)

* Visualize multiple sort algorithms **in parallel**.
* Over **ten most common sort algorithms**, including Quick sort, Merge sort and Bubble sort.
* Start/Pause feature and (manual) **single step execution**.
* Adjustment of the **running speed**.
* Arbitrary **number of elements** to be sorted.

# Installing & Running

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed **Java 8.xx** installed on your machine. Then you have two options.

1. Go to `VisualSorting/out/artifacts/VisualSorting_jar/` and double-click on `VisualSorting.jar`
or if thats not working, open a terminal in the same folder and type `java -jar VisualSorting.jar`.
2. The easiest way of compiling and building the application yourself is by importing
it into IntelliJ IDEA (project files already exist).
