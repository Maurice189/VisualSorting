	<h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>Selection sort is an <b>in-place</b> algorithm with O(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>) time complexity.
        In each iteration the <b>smallest element</b> of the unsorted list is calculated and afterwards added
        to the already sorted list. Conceptually this makes selection sort <b>very similar to insertion sort</b>.
        However selection sort has to scan through all elements to find the minimum, whereas insertion sort
        only scans as many elements as it needs in order to place to element to the correct position. Despite
        the unfavorable efficiency aspects, selection sort <b>performs only <i>n</i> write operations in total</b>,
        which can be crucial fact if <b>write operations</b> are rather expensive (EEPROM or Flash).
    </p>
