# Please note

**THIS SOFTWARE IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT - CONSIDER THE ACTUAL STATE AS A TEASER**

# Description

Visual Sorting is an application that visualizes the run behaviour of different
sort algorithms in parallel. The concept of VisualSorting is somewhat similar to [sound-of-sorting](https://github.com/bingmann/sound-of-sorting) developed by Timo Bingmann. 

The development of Visual Sorting is still in progress, so you may encounter bugs. 
In that case I would highly appreciate a bug report. Thanks in advance !

# Features

* Visualize multiple sort algorithms in parallel.
* Over ten most common sort algorithms, including Quick sort, Merge sort and Bubble sort.
* Start/Pause feature and (manual) single step execution.
* Adjustment of the running speed.
* Arbitrary number of elements to be sorted.

# Installing & Running

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed **Java 8.xx** installed on your machine. Then you have two options.

1. Go to `VisualSorting/out/artifacts/VisualSorting_jar/` and double-click on `VisualSorting.jar`
or if thats not working, open a terminal in the same folder and type `java -jar VisualSorting.jar`.
2. The easiest way of compiling and building the application yourself is by importing
it into IntelliJ IDEA (project files are already present).
